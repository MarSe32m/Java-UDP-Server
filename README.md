# Java-UDP-Server
UDP Server

This is an abstraction over datagram sockets.
It's intended to be easy to use and expand on.

GameServer is an example implementation of the Server class.
BitWriteStream, BitReadStream, and xxxPacket classes are my own implementations/abstractions of packets
The main point is the abstract functions
